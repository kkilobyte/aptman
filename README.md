# aptman
Tool for Debian users temporarily using an Arch machine
# What is aptman, specifically?
Imagine you are a Debian user, or well a user of a Debian-based distro. You could easily get *too* used to apt, meaning you keep running apt commands within an Arch system, whenever you are in an Arch VNC or just borrowing a friend's ThinkPad to try out Neverball because you ran out of storage. You might try to run `sudo apt install neverball`, even though Arch uses `sudo pacman -S neverball`. So, what if you made apt run pacman, if the system doesn't even use apt anyways?
# Why?
Ease of use.
# Do you even use it yourself?
Nope.
